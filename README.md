Target: Design a game where you control a player performing a 3 point contest. With a system that will emulate real life basketball physics and keeps track of how many 3 pointers you make in a time frame, showing the results in the end. We potentially might try to add more mechanics / gamemodes but for now limiting the scope to easily feasible.

      Generally been working towards getting the game to be in a "prototype version", mainly working on core functions such as ball physics (bled into ball handling), colliders with the hoops, and very basic audio mechanics for playtesting.
